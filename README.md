THE CHALLENGE
Write a program and associated unit tests that can price a basket of goods, accounting for
special offers.
The goods that can be purchased, which are all priced in GBP, are:
 Soup – 65p per tin
 Bread – 80p per loaf
 Milk £1.30 per bottle
 Apples - £1.00 per bag

Current special offers are:
 Apples have 10% off their normal price this week
 Buy 2 tins of soup and get a loaf of bread for half price

The program should accept a list of items in the basket and output the subtotal, the special offer discounts
and the final price.
Input should be via the command line in the form PriceBasket item1 item2 item3 ...

The code and design should meet these requirements but be sufficiently flexible to allow for future
extensibility. The code should be well structured, suitably commented, have error handling, and be tested.
